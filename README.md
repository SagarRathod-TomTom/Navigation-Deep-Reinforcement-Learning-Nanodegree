## Project Goal

The goal is to train an agent to navigate a virtual world and collect as many yellow banana as possible while avoiding 
blue bananas.

## Environment Details

The environment is based on [Unity ML-agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents).

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around the agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
* 0 - move forward.
* 1 - move backward.
* 2 - turn left.
* 3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.


## Note

The project environment is similar to, but not identical to the Banana Collector environment on the [Unity ML-Agents GitHub page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#banana-collector).
For this project, you will not need to install Unity. You can download the environment from one of the links below.
